# ABSTRACT

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern industrial settings, unexpected machinery downtime leads to significant financial losses and inefficiencies. Predictive Maintanence which is designed to predict the health of the machine based on the data captured by the various sensor and data is processed. Unlike the traditional systems this relies on the data collected by the various sensors to predict and send the alerts to the appropriate authorities to take the necessary action.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To predict the machine health we can use the tinyML directly on the microcontroller. Using the data we also establish a healthy baseline and based on that we can predict the anomalies in the machinery. This feature provides the automated alert system that alerts the authorities to take preemptive action which reduces the downtime and increase the run-time of the machinery.
