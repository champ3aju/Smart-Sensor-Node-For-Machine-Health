## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Smart Sensor Node** capable of monitoring the health of rotating machinery in real-time. By leveraging **TinyML on the Edge (STM32)**, the system performs local fault classification (Normal, Warning, Fault) without relying solely on the cloud. Data is visualized locally on an OLED display and synchronized with **AWS IoT Core** via an ESP32 bridge for remote monitoring.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Multi-Parameter Sensing:** Real-time monitoring of Temperature, Current, Vibration, and Speed (RPM).
- **Edge Intelligence:** Runs TinyML models locally on the STM32F407VGT6 to detect anomalies instantly.
- **Hybrid Connectivity:** - **Local:** OLED Display & SD Card Logging.
  - **Cloud:** MQTT transmission to AWS IoT Core via ESP32.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Efficient signal processing and feature extraction at the edge.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system is divided into three main layers: Sensing, Processing (Edge), and Communication (Cloud).

![Block Diagram](docs/block_diagram.png)
1. **Sensing Layer:** Sensors collect raw data from the machine.
2. **Processing Layer (STM32):** Pre-processes data, runs the TFLite model, and determines machine health.
3. **Communication Layer (ESP32):** Acts as a Wi-Fi bridge to send data to AWS.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. STM32 Firmware
```Open stm32_firmware in STM32CubeIDE.
Build the project to generate the .elf or .bin file.
Flash the code to the STM32F407 board.
```
2. ESP32 Bridge
```Open esp32_firmware in Arduino IDE.
Update the SSID, PASSWORD, and AWS_ENDPOINT in the code.
Flash to the ESP32 module.
```
3. Running the System
```Power up the system. The STM32 will initialize sensors.
The OLED should display "System Init..." followed by real-time sensor values.
If a fault is simulated (e.g., obstructing the fan), the display will show "Condition: FAULT".
Check the AWS IoT Console to see the data stream in real-time.
